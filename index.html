            <p class="dholera-start">Dholera is a smart city in Gujarat which is in India. It is that India has its own Singapore in Gujarat. It is spreaded in a large area which is around the twice of the Mumbai. Its area is around 902 Square Kilometres. There was an ABCD Building there and it performs many functions and it was very important for the Dholera. And if you want to know that what does the ABCD Building do, why it is Important for the Dholera and many Much information about a city present in Gujarat named Dholera. There was an ABCD building present there which work is to control the whole dholera city. All CCTV Cameras which are implement in the dholera city by the government will see in the Dholera. <br><br> For example if your company is 10 floors high and your 1st floor catches fire and you did not know but the ABCD Building will call you and tell that go away from your office because the office catches fire and if you call the fire fighter so it will take much time, but an government organization have the fire fighter, ambulance and etc. So they tell that go to the office and save the employees present there. <br><br>An Image of the ABCD Building present in Dholera is below. </p>
            <img src="ABCD-Building-Dholera-SIR.jpg" alt="" srcset="" class="ABCD-Building">
            <p class="dholera-start">Above image is of the ABCD Building which is the center of the dholera by not its location. It is by the importance of it. As the Mumbai which is the India's financial hub city area is 603.4 square kilometres. And at other side Dholera area is around 902 to 903 square kilometres. It means it is 50% more area of Mumbai. Many cities cut many trees to make the building and skyscrapers , but in Dholera you cannot see it. Because many years before it was an barren land and now it is become and beautiful smart city of gujarat. There was many trees present their. Dholera was made when the Chief Minister of Gujarat was the today's time Prime Minister who is Mr. Narendra Damodar Das Modi. </p>
            <h2 align="center">Please Focus on it</h2>
            <p class="dholera-start idea">I want to give a suggestion to the Indian Government that in our country It is important that to make minimum 50 more smart cities like the Dholera. I known it is not that much easy but I want to tell that there was a problem in our country that it not much focus on the growth of the country, it focus on the politics. I can't specific any party and I am not with any party. I am with my country. I made this platform to increase our India literacy. Many peoples living in our country do not know that what is happening in our country, what does our country is achieving. The china is much large in the population and the area but does it not growing. Obviously No, if our country government also want to do something and not only thing or want, they take actions on that also so our country will much advance than the singapore and others. And I also want to tell this that it is not only government work. It is all the Indians work. I will also make a content in which I will share some ideas from me to the Indian Government and if they like it or it was useful so I request that plese implement that in our country. </p>
            <marquee behavior="" direction="left" class="purpose">I have made this platform to increase my country's literacy. I know it is very difficult but many other Indians work with me so it will be very easy to make my country 80% literacy from the 69%. 82% is my target to achieve for my country.</marquee>
